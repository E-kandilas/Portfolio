const aboutMe = `Hello, Iâ€™m Manny.
In my previous life I was a real estate professional focused on growing relationships to foster business.
I have experience in unloading foreclosures as well as negotiating deals regarding investment properties. 
I picked up ethereum mining as a pastime and by extension began spending a significant portion of my free time browsing medium.com. 
My hobby began to grow away from mining as I started to research programming. I purchased Head first Javascript and began to teach myself. 
After passing my first group of specs on Codewars I was hooked! I started to research how to change careers and soon found myself enrolled 
at Fullstack Academy. Now I seek to grow my skills as a developer alongside a team that finds fulfillment in working together.
